### Story
Yuki of your friend came up with a social media app "Boyaki" where users can post and connect short text up to 140 characters.
Yuki's investor said "Show me something for the time being!" 
Yuki asked you to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in three days.
Having found possibilities in the idea of Yuki, you took on the creation of an MVP.
We will take advantage of AWS Amplify to make a quick MVP.
Now let's create an MVP that you want to show to investors in a short time!

{{% notice tip%}}
Boyaki means 'tweet a bit glumly' in Japanese.
